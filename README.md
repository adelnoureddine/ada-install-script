# Ada (GNAT and GPRBuild) installation scripts

There are two scripts to download and install the Ada GNAT compiler and GPRBuild from the Alire project's FSF builds.

The scripts will download the proper version and install to a specified folder.

You still need to add both folders to the operating system path.

Scripts available for:
- Linux x86_64 (shell/bash script)
- Windows 10/11 (PowerShell script)
